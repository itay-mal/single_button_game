# Single Button Game 🎮

A Single Button Game - dedicated to run on ESP32 micropython  

## To Use

- Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/avisalmon/single_button) to setup circuit and environment.  
- Upload files in [micropyton_files](/micropython_files/) to a microcontroller flashed with [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master) firmware.
- Have Fun 🤟  

 > NOTE: pygame based files were used for initial development and eventually were abandoned in favor of the development of the micropython (with actual LCD api etc) so the versions are NOT aligned

## Further Upgrades Proposals

If you read all the way down here you must have some spare time 😁  
few additions that I think might be nice to have:  

- Fix "lag" when hitting collectibles - due to sleep in the sound mechanism.
- Expand all walls, instead only new walls as currently.
- Add progress dependant difficulty features - e.g. walls getting closer faster, running speed increase, collectible frequency...

If you do get to develop this further, please DM me, im curiouse what could be added here 😃
